            <p><b>Title of research study:</b> Assessing Adaptive Control via Trial-Unique Stimuli</p>
            <p><b>Key Information</b></p>
            <p>This research study is conducted by Dr. Tobias Egner of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at Duke University. Its purpose is to investigate the ease in which people switch between tasks. </p>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT: We’ll need to record your voice during the task to pick up your answers, so it is required that you have a high-quality audio input into your computer (native to some laptops, for others may require an external microphone or headphones with microphone capabilities).</strong></p>
    
            <p><b>Procedure: </b>In this experiment, you will be asked to identify competing stimuli (e.g. images and words) on the computer screen. This will involve speaking aloud into your computer’s microphone. To participate, therefore, you will need a microphone-enabled device connected to your computer. Once you are finished with the task, you will also be asked to fill out a few questions about your demographics. If any questions make you uncomfortable, feel free to skip it, but please try to answer as many of the questions as you can.</p>
    
            <p><b>Benefits and Risks: </b>We know of no risks or benefits to you for participating in this research study. The potential benefits of this research lie in the knowledge that will be acquired. </p>
    
            <p><b>Confidentiality: </b>Our records will include the demographic information you report to us (your age, gender, etc.) as well as your task performance data. We employ a participant code system to ensure that this information is not directly linked to your name or consent form. The consent and demographic forms as well as the de-identified performance data will be stored in a secure location. All data will be kept for at least six years or as long as is required by Duke University or any journal that may publish these findings. If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference, only group results will be reported. However, your data, with direct identifiers removed, may be used for future studies and/or shared with other researchers. The audio recordings of your voice will not be shared.</p>
    
            <p><b>Compensation and Participation:</b> For participating in this study, you will earn $_______. We will screen your responses prior to compensation. If you do not complete the task, or we think that you completed it to an unsatisfactory standard (i.e. you do not follow the instructions), you will not be compensated. The entire experiment should take less than 30 minutes.</p>
