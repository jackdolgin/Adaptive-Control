        <p><b>Title of research study:</b> Assessing Adaptive Control via Trial-Unique Stimuli</p>

        <p><b>Title of research study:</b> Examining the relationship between attention and learning.</p>
        <p><b>Key Information</b></p>
        <p>This consent form asks you to take part in a research study. The study is being conducted by Dr. Paul Seli, PhD., Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University.</p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b> In daily life, we sometimes need to have a strong and stable focus on a single task at hand, at the expense of engaging with alternative activities, while at other times we need to be more flexible, switching frequently between different tasks, at the expense of doing any one of them with the utmost focus. Being able to strategically shift between different brain states (ranging from highly stable to highly flexible) so as to best suit the current environmental demands is a crucial but poorly understood cognitive ability called “strategic meta-flexibility.”</p>
        <p>We are interested to see how or if people can learn to use cues to increase their flexibility. In this experiment, the tones were paired with "switching" or "repeating" between tasks. We hypothesize that participants would learn to associate one tone with more flexibility (switching). In the final block of trials, the tones were randomly presented so that we could measure whether it would improve your performance on switch trials. If you would like to know more or have any other questions about the experiment or your data, please feel free to contact me at nicholaus.brosowsky@duke.edu or Tobias Egner at tobias.egner@duke.edu.</p>
