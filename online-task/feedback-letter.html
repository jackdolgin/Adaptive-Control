            <p>Thank you for participating in this study! In daily life, we sometimes need to have a strong and stable focus on a single task at hand, at the expense of engaging with alternative activities, while at other times we need to be more flexible, switching frequently between different tasks, at the expense of doing any one of them with the utmost focus. Being able to strategically shift between different brain states (ranging from highly stable to highly flexible) so as to best suit the current environmental demands is a crucial but poorly understood cognitive ability called “strategic meta-flexibility.” We are interested to see if people learn to enter this stable state more often as the number of trials calling for it increases—trials when the word and picture do not match.</p>
