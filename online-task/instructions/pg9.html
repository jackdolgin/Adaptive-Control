            Welcome to the main portion of the experiment! Itâ€™ll work just like the practice trials, only there will be many more trials.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trials will be split among <span id='startMain'></span> breaks, and this main portion of the study should total no more than 25 minutes (probably less).
        </p>

            document.querySelector("#startMain").innerHTML = (blockSequence.length - 1);
