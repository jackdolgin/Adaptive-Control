    <h3>2. Voice Recording Details:</h3>
    <p>We don’t want you to try to participate and not get credit, so before you begin and at checkpoints during the experiment we will ask you to say a few words and test that we’re processing your audio adequately.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will use an automated system to determine whether what you said was indeed the words on the screen, so also please try to enunciate the words as best you can. It is quite a high-quality speech-to-text processor, but do note that occasionally it may not accurately pick up what you said.
    </p>
    <p>
         You’ll have four chances at every checkpoint to properly say the prompted words, just in case anything does go awry on a given attempt. However, please note that we can’t guarantee your payment unless you successfully pass each checkpoint, so it is quite important that you answer them carefully.
