        <h3>Voice Recording Details</h3>
        <p>
            We will use an automated system to process your voice responses, so you’ll need to enunciate when you speak and avoid using filler words like "Um".
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s practice! Please read aloud each of the three words you see on the next screen, in order, taking a second or two of a pause between words. You’ll have <span id="speechRecognitionDuration"></span> seconds, and if it doesn’t get processed correctly you’ll have <span id='failMax'></span> more chances.
        </p>
        <script>
            document.querySelector("#speechRecognitionDuration").innerHTML = speechRecognitionDuration;
            document.querySelector("#failMax").innerHTML = failMax;
        </script>
