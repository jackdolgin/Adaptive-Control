            Instructions
        </h3>
        <p>
            The task, which lasts approximately 30 minutes, involves simply giving voice responses to different <span id='letterOrWord'></span>-image combinations that appear on the screen<span id='instr1End'></span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span id='opening'></span> Your job will be to say what the image is regardless of what the <span id='sensible'></span>, and to do so as quickly as you can. It’s that simple!
        </p>
