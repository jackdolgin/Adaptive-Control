    <h3>1. Instructions:</h3>
    <p>
         The task, which lasts approximately 30 minutes, involves simply giving voice responses to different word-image combinations that appear on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
         You’ll see a word on each trial overlaying an image, which sometimes will match the word and sometimes won’t. Your job will be to say what the image is regardless of what the word is, and to do so as quickly as you can. It’s that simple!
