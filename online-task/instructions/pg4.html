        <h3>Success</h3>
        <p>
            Well done! There will be <span id="futureCheckpoints"></span> breaks during the main portion of the task (which you’ll hear more about briefly), and each will contain another one of these audio checks.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re still interested in participating, you can now read the instructions for the task.
        </p>
        <script>
            document.querySelector("#futureCheckpoints").innerHTML = (blockSequence.length - 1);
