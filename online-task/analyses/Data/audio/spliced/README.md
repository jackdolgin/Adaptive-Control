Audio files one trial in duration are stored in this folder. Because of the identifiable nature of participants' recordings, the complete folder, with data, is available only on our local computer. This folder is structured so there is a different subdirectory for each participant, and within each subdirectory is a recording for each trial (spliced from the block-long recordings stored in the `../full` directory).
